# monocular camera distance estimation and object follower
Distance estimation with monocular webcam using visual bacons using transfer learning with YOLOv8 

Implemented an advanced computer vision project focused on object detection and distance estimation. Leveraging transfer learning techniques with the YOLOv8 model in PyTorch, the project achieved an impressive 94% accuracy in estimating distances to flagged objects. The project involved collecting and labeling a comprehensive dataset using OpenCV and an annotation tool. Real-time distance estimation was achieved through the development of a sophisticated algorithm, allowing for rapid processing at 18 frames per second (fps). The camera was calibrated to ensure accurate distance measurements. This project showcased expertise in deep learning, transfer learning, data collection, labeling, and real-time computer vision, highlighting a strong command of advanced computer vision techniques and their practical application in real-world scenarios.
